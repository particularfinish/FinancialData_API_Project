# FinancialData_API_Project
Mini-project with short analysis of a particular stock performance in 2017.

For this mini project, we will focus on equities data from the Frankfurt Stock Exhange (FSE), which is available for free. We'll try and analyze the stock prices of a company called Carl Zeiss Meditec, which manufactures tools for eye examinations, as well as medical lasers for laser eye surgery: https://www.zeiss.com/meditec/int/home.html. The company is listed under the stock ticker AFX_X.

While there is a dedicated Python package for connecting to the Quandl API, this mini-project will only use the requests package, which can be easily downloaded using pip or conda. You can find the documentation for the package here: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/

This project will be done without pandas, using Python's native data structures - dictionaries, though some questions can also be answered using lists.
